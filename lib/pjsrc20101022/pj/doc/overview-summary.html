Parallel Java (PJ) is
an API and middleware for parallel programming in 100% Java
on shared memory multiprocessor (SMP) parallel computers,
cluster parallel computers,
and hybrid SMP cluster parallel computers.
PJ was developed by Professor Alan Kaminsky
and his student Luke McOmber
in the Department of Computer Science
at the Rochester Institute of Technology.

<P>
I am happy to answer general questions about the Parallel Java Library,
receive bug reports,
and entertain requests for additional features.
Please contact me by email at
ark<FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFFFF">&shy;</FONT>&#64;<FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFFFF">&shy;</FONT>cs.rit.edu.
I regret that I am unable to provide technical support,
specific installation instructions for your system,
or advice about configuring your parallel computer hardware.

<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="requirements"><H2>System Requirements</H2></A>

<P>
PJ was developed using
Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.5.
When compiling and running PJ programs,
you must use JDK 1.5.
PJ uses features of the Java language and platform
introduced in JDK 1.5
and will not compile with earlier JDK versions.

<P>
PJ will work with JDK 1.6.
However, my tests have revealed serious performance issues
when a multithreaded PJ program
is run on an SMP parallel computer
with JDK 1.6.
Due to some as-yet-unfathomed behavior
of the JDK 1.6 JIT compiler
and/or the JDK 1.6 thread scheduler,
SMP parallel programs that experienced near-ideal speedups with JDK 1.5
experience far-less-than-ideal speedups with JDK 1.6
on the same machine.
For now I recommend using PJ with JDK 1.5.

<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="installation"><H2>Installation</H2></A>

<P>
There are two versions of the PJ distribution,
an executable distribution
and a source distribution.

<P>
<B>Executable distribution.</B>
The executable distribution comes in a Java Archive (JAR) file
named <TT>"pj<I>YYYYMMDD</I>.jar"</TT>,
where <I>YYYYMMDD</I> are the year, month, and date.
The executable distribution includes the PJ class files only.
To install the executable distribution,
simply store the JAR file somewhere.
You may wish to change the file name,
say to <TT>"pj.jar"</TT>.

<P>
<B>Source distribution.</B>
The source distribution comes in a Java Archive (JAR) file
named <TT>"pjsrc<I>YYYYMMDD</I>.jar"</TT>,
where <I>YYYYMMDD</I> are the year, month, and date.
The source distribution includes the PJ class files,
source files, and documentation files (Javadoc).
To install the source distribution,
just unpack the JAR file.
The source distribution expands into a subdirectory
named <TT>"pj"</TT>.
If you already have a subdirectory of that name
which you want to save,
be sure to unpack the JAR file
in some other directory.
Documentation is stored under the directory
<TT>"pj/doc"</TT>;
point your HTML browser to that directory.
Java source files and class files
are stored under the directory
<TT>"pj/lib"</TT>.

<P>
<B>Installation on a SMP computer.</B>
To run PJ programs on a shared memory multiprocessor (SMP) parallel computer,
no further installation is required.

<P>
<B>Installation on a cluster.</B>
To run PJ programs on a cluster parallel computer,
in addition to installing the PJ JAR file,
you must configure and run certain daemon processes
on the frontend and backend processors of the cluster.
For further information, see package
<A HREF="edu/rit/pj/cluster/package-summary.html">edu.rit.pj.cluster</A>.

<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="usage"><H2>Usage</H2></A>

<P>
<B>Executable distribution.</B>
When compiling and executing Java programs
that use PJ,
if you have installed the executable distribution,
you must set your classpath
to include the PJ JAR file.
Here is an example of a command for the <TT>bash</TT> shell
to set the classpath to the current directory
plus the PJ JAR file:

<P>
<TT>export&nbsp;CLASSPATH=.:/home/fac/ark/public_html/pj.jar</TT>

<P>
Here is an example of a command for the <TT>csh</TT> shell
to set the classpath to the current directory
plus the PJ JAR file:

<P>
<TT>setenv&nbsp;CLASSPATH&nbsp;.:/home/fac/ark/public_html/pj.jar</TT>

<P>
<B>Source distribution.</B>
When compiling and executing Java programs
that use PJ,
if you have installed the source distribution,
you must set your classpath
to include the top-level directory
under which PJ's Java class files are stored.
Here is an example of a command for the <TT>bash</TT> shell
to set the classpath to the current directory
plus the PJ directory:

<P>
<TT>export&nbsp;CLASSPATH=.:/home/fac/ark/public_html/pj/lib</TT>

<P>
Here is an example of a command for the <TT>csh</TT> shell
to set the classpath to the current directory

<P><DT>24-Dec-2008
<DD>
The Parallel Java class files are now compiled
using JDK 1.5 again.
Switching to JDK 1.6 proved to be a mistake.
My tests have revealed serious performance issues
when a multithreaded PJ program
is run on an SMP parallel computer
with JDK 1.6.
Due to some as-yet-unfathomed behavior
of the JDK 1.6 JIT compiler
and/or the JDK 1.6 thread scheduler,
SMP parallel programs that experienced near-ideal speedups with JDK 1.5
experience far-less-than-ideal speedups with JDK 1.6
on the same machine.
For now I recommend using PJ with JDK 1.5.

<P><DT>26-Nov-2008
<DD>
The Parallel Java class files are now compiled
using JDK 1.6.
<P>
In package edu.rit.mp.ChannelGroup
and in class edu.rit.pj.Comm:
Added the ability to receive a message
whose tag lies in a given range,
in addition to receiving a message with a specific tag or any tag.
This change is source compatible with existing software
but is not binary compatible;
you may need to recompile your programs.
<P>

<P><DT>25-Jul-2008
<DD>
In package edu.rit.compbio.phyl:
Added some features to the phylogenetic tree construction programs.
The output report now includes

and the Jukes-Cantor distance matrix.
For each maximum parsimony phylogenetic tree,
the least squares branch lengths are computed and displayed,
and the trees are presented in ascending order of squared error.
<P>
In package edu.rit.pj.cluster:
Fixed a bug in class NonPjJobFrontend;
an IllegalMonitorStateException was thrown
when a backend processor was assigned to the job.

<P><DT>20-Jul-2008
<DD>
In package edu.rit.compbio.phyl:

a NullPointerException was thrown if the resource could not be found.
<P>
In packages edu.rit.draw and edu.rit.draw.item:
Removed the ability to rotate a DrawingItem.
Added the ability to scale, shear, and rotate a Group.
To apply transformations to one or more DrawingItems,
put the DrawingItems in a Group
and apply transformations to the Group.
This change reduces the size of a serialized Drawing object.
As a result of this change,
Drawing objects serialized with previous versions of the Library
are incompatible with the present version of the Library.
<P>
Added package edu.rit.mri
with sequential and parallel programs for solving
a magnetic resonance image spin relaxometry analysis problem.
Added package edu.rit.mri.test

Eliminated classes HybridJobScheduler, HybridConfiguration,
HybridBackendInfo, and HybridJobInfo.
Changed class Configuration
to include the number of CPUs in each backend node.
As a consequence,
this version of the Parallel Java cluster middleware
will not interoperate with previous versions.

<P><DT>13-May-2008
<DD>
In package edu.rit.mp:
Fixed a bug in class ChannelGroup;
if the channel group had a connect listener
and another process set up a connection,
there was a race condition between the thread calling the connect listener
and the thread receiving messages from the channel,
possibly causing the channel to be in an incorrect state.

<P><DT>09-May-2008
<DD>
In package edu.rit.clu.monte:
Added programs AesTestSeq and AesTestClu
that perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
on the AES block cipher
operating as a pseudorandom number generator.
The AesTestClu program illustrates
the all-to-all, exclusive-scan, and reduce
collective communication operations.
<P>
In class edu.rit.pj.Comm:
Added the <TT>allToAll()</TT>, <TT>scan()</TT>,
and <TT>exclusiveScan()</TT>

Fixed bugs in class edu.rit.pj.reduction.ReduceArrays;
in each method,
the number of array elements to reduce was one too large.

<P><DT>07-May-2008
<DD>
In package edu.rit.pj.cluster:
Fixed a bug in class JobScheduler and class HybridJobScheduler.
If a Job Frontend connected to the Job Scheduler,
but the Job Frontend terminated before sending any messages,
the Job Scheduler's channel remained open forever,
eventually leading to resource exhaustion.

<P><DT>25-Apr-2008
<DD>
In package edu.rit.pj.cluster:
Added the <TT>jobtime</TT> configuration command
to class Configuration and class HybridConfiguration.
This configures the PJ Job Scheduler

<P>
In package edu.rit.util:
Changed the implementation of class Random.
Changed class DefaultRandom to use a hashing algorithm
instead of a multiplicative congruential generator (MCG) algorithm;
the hashing algorithm avoids certain weaknesses of the MCG algorithm.
The previous version of class DefaultRandom,
which uses a MCG algorithm,
is still available as class Mcg1Random.
<P>
In package edu.rit.mp.buf:
Fixed bugs in the object buffer subclasses;
the serialized representation was not reset in all cases
when the buffer contents were changed.
Fixed bugs in the matrix buffer subclasses;
an ArithmeticException was thrown
when receiving into a matrix buffer
for a slice of zero columns.

<P><DT>11-Feb-2008
<DD>
In package edu.rit.clu.antimatter:
Changed programs AntiprotonSeq and AntiprotonClu
to put the antiproton motion calculations in subroutines.
Added program AntiprotonClu2
which uses pipelined send-receive message passing operations
instead of all-gather collective communication operations.
Added program AntiprotonClu3
which uses pipelined send-receive message passing operations
and which overlaps computation with communication.
<P>
In package edu.rit.numeric.plot.impl:
Fixed a bug in class XYPlot;
an exception was thrown when plotting a line
for a data series with one data point.

<P><DT>07-Feb-2008
<DD>

Added methods to class Channel
to obtain the channel group IDs
of the near end channel group
and the far end channel group.

<DD>
In package edu.rit.io:
Added class DoubleMatrixFile
for reading and writing <TT>double[][]</TT> matrices,
or portions thereof,
from and to files.
<P>
In package edu.rit.smp.network:
Changed all the programs
to use class edu.rit.io.DoubleMatrixFile
for input and output of the distance matrix files.
<P>
In package edu.rit.clu.network:
Changed all the programs
to use class edu.rit.io.DoubleMatrixFile
for input and output of the distance matrix files.
Changed class FloydClu
so that each process reads a slice of the distance matrix from the input file
and writes a slice of the distance matrix to a per-process output file.

<P><DT>31-Dec-2007
<DD>
In package edu.rit.pj:
Made the <TT>start()</TT> and <TT>next()</TT> methods
of classes IntegerSchedule and LongSchedule public;
this lets a schedule object divide a range into chunks
apart from a parallel for loop.
<P>
In package edu.rit.clu.fractal:
Rewrote class MandelbrotSetClu2.
Added class MandelbrotSetClu3.
<P>
In package edu.rit.io:

and far-end-initiated connections.
Changed class ChannelGroup
not to start listening for incoming connections
until a new <TT>startListening()</TT> method is called.
Changed class ChannelGroup
to eliminate the methods that query for channels.
These changes were needed
to support the new hybrid job scheduler.
<P>
In package edu.rit.pj:

so that when one process
initiates a connection to another process,
the initiating process sends a message
identifying the initiating process's rank.
This change was needed
to support the new hybrid job scheduler.
<P>
Changed several classes throughout the Library
to use 128 extra padding bytes to avert cache interference,
instead of 64.
(128 bytes is the more prevalent cache line size
in modern CPUs.)

<DD>
In the unnamed package:
Added class View,
a main program that can display
either a drawing (class edu.rit.draw.Drawing)

Added interface Viewable which extends interface Displayable;
to show itself on the screen,
a Viewable object can return a DisplayableFrame.
Drawings and plots are now Viewable objects.
Changed class DisplayableFrame
so that when it saves the displayable object in a PNG file,
the object is saved at its zoomed size.

<P><DT>08-Dec-2007

instead of a PNG image file.
<P>
In package edu.rit.mp:
Added a static <TT>emptyBuffer()</TT> factory method
to each buffer subclass.
Fixed a bug in class NetworkChannelReceiveThread;
an incoming message was not received properly
if the number of items in the message
exceeded the number of items in the destination buffer.
Removed the I/O completion hook and chained I/O request capabilities
from class IORequest;
these reduced message passing performance too much.
Changed the non-blocking send and receive methods
in class ChannelGroup
to take an IORequest argument
instead of creating their own new IORequest object.
<P>
In package edu.rit.pj:
Removed enumeration Wait.
In its place, added class BarrierAction
to specify what should happen during a barrier synchronization.
Changed all the <TT>execute()</TT> methods in class ParallelRegion

In package edu.rit.pj:
Re-implemented the SMP parallel programming classes
to use more extensively the Java Concurrency Utilities
in packages java.util.concurrent,

Eliminated class ParallelSectionGroup;
in its place is a ParallelRegion <TT>execute()</TT> method
that can take any number of ParallelSection arguments.
Eliminated the <TT>noWait()</TT> method
of various parallel constructs;
in its place is a ParallelRegion <TT>execute()</TT> method argument
telling whether the parallel team threads should wait for each other

Changed classes Schedule and LongSchedule
so that user-defined schedule subclasses
can be written;
such schedule subclasses can also be specified at run time
with a command line flag (<TT>-Dpj.schedule</TT>).
<P>
Consolidated packages edu.rit.pj.op and edu.rit.pj.shared
into one package, edu.rit.pj.reduction.
The new package has classes

Factory methods are provided for single items,
arrays, matrices,
thread safe shared items,

<P>
In package edu.rit.pj.cluster:
Added class Configuration

<DD>
In package edu.rit.phyl.pars:
Changed class DnaSequence to add extra padding
to the byte array holding the sites,
to avert cache interference in an SMP parallel program.
Added class MaxParsBnb2,
a main program for branch-and-bound search
that does not shuffle the input DNA sequences
into descending distance order.
(Class MaxParsBnb does shuffle the input DNA sequences
into descending distance order.)

<P><DT>06-May-2007
<DD>
In package edu.rit.phyl.pars:
Made several further changes
to reduce the storage requirement and running time
of the MaxParsExh program.

<P><DT>23-Apr-2007
<DD>
In package edu.rit.phyl.pars:
Changed class DnaSequence
to share the base sequence storage array

this reduces the storage requirement and running time
of the MaxParsExh tree construction program.

<P><DT>22-Apr-2007
<DD>
Added packages edu.rit.phyl, edu.rit.phyl.pars,
and edu.rit.phyl.pars.test

for receiving.

<P><DT>17-Mar-2007
<DD>
In package edu.rit.pj.cluster:
Changed the Job Frontend to use SSH
to spawn Job Backend processes.
This authenticates the Job Backend processes
into the user's account
and allows the Job Backend processes
to access the user's files directly
without having to go through the Job Frontend process.
(Eliminating the use of SSH
in the 06-Nov-2006 version
proved to be a mistake.)

<P><DT>16-Feb-2007

Added the <TT>reset()</TT> method
to classes edu.rit.mp.ObjectBuf,
edu.rit.mp.buf.ObjectItemBuf,
edu.rit.mp.buf.ObjectArrayBuf,

the <TT>nextInt()</TT> method
could sometimes consume more than one value
from the pseudorandom sequence,
leading to incorrect sequence splitting in a parallel program.

the job frontend's lease timers for the job backend
were not started at the correct time,
which could result in an incorrect lease timeout
that incorrectly aborted the job.

<P><DT>14-Jan-2007
<DD>
In package edu.rit.pj.cluster:
Changed the Job Scheduler;
when a job frontend process reports that a job backend process failed,
the Job Scheduler will keep the backend processor available.

In package edu.rit.image:
Added class SyncGrayImage

Some minor changes in the Job Scheduler Daemon's web interface.
Fixed a bug in class edu.rit.pj.Comm;
a NullPointerException occurred

<P><DT>06-Nov-2006
<DD>
A major redesign of the PJ message passing middleware
for cluster parallel programming.
The goals of the redesign
are to reduce the time needed to send messages
and to make it easier to deploy and use PJ
on cluster parallel computers.
The principal changes are:
<UL>
<LI>
In package edu.rit.mp:
Changed the channel and channel group classes
to use Java "Old I/O" (thread-based)
instead of Java "New I/O" (selector-based).
Old I/O's measured performance is better than New I/O's.
<LI>
In package edu.rit.pj.cluster:
Eliminated the use of SSH to launch backend processes;
PJ now has its own Job Launcher written in 100% Java.
The job frontend process runs in the user's account as before,
but the job backend processes are no longer authenticated
into the user's account;
rather, they run in a separate PJ account.
Eliminating SSH greatly reduces the startup time for a PJ job.
All the other classes were rewritten as well.
The Job Scheduler now has a web interface
for displaying the cluster status.
<LI>
In package edu.rit.pj:
Changed the implementation of class Comm
to use the new classes in package edu.rit.pj.cluster.
However, the exported methods of class Comm
still have the same signatures as before,
so programs using class Comm do not need to change.
<LI>
Added package edu.rit.pj.io with class StreamFile.
This class lets a PJ program running in the PJ account on a backend processor
read and write files stored in the user's account on the frontend processor.
This capability is needed
because PJ no longer authenticates the job backend processes
into the user's account.
Instead, using class StreamFile, the job backend processes
communicate with the job frontend process
(which is authenticated into the user's account)
to read and write files.
All the application programs were changed to use class StreamFile.
</UL>

<P><DT>09-Mar-2006

Removed the deprecated package edu.rit.matrix.
Removed the deprecated constructors
in the array buffer classes

Added non-blocking send and receive operations
to class edu.rit.pj.Comm.
<P>
In package edu.rit.mp.buf:
Added buffer classes for matrices of all primitive types.
Added a buffer class for a matrix of objects.
<P>
Fixed a bug in class edu.rit.clu.particles.ProtonClu3;
computation and communication used the same array,
so incoming new data could overwrite the previous data
being used in the computation.

<P><DT>16-Feb-2006
<DD>
Added the send-receive operation to class edu.rit.pj.Comm,
including a non-blocking version.

as well as buffer classes
for sending and receiving 2-D vectors
in message passing parallel programs.

Added package edu.rit.clu.particles
with sequential and cluster parallel programs
for the Particle Simulation,
an <I>N</I>-bodies problem.

<P><DT>12-Feb-2006
<DD>
Package edu.rit.matrix was deprecated.
The classes in this package are still available
but should no longer be used.
Package edu.rit.matrix will be removed
in a future release of the Parallel Java Library.
The package was deprecated because
accessing arrays and matrices using class methods
takes too long in a parallel program.
<P>
Added package edu.rit.image.
This package contains image classes
equivalent to the ones in package edu.rit.matrix.
However, to improve running times,
the new image classes
operate on primitive matrices
(type <TT>byte[][]</TT> or <TT>int[][]</TT>)
instead of the matrix classes.
<P>
In package edu.rit.mp.buf:
Added matrix buffer classes
equivalent to the ones in package edu.rit.matrix
for byte, double, and integer matrices.
However, to improve running times,
the new matrix buffer classes
operate on primitive matrices
instead of the matrix classes.
<P>
In package edu.rit.mp.buf:
The constructors in all the array buffer classes
were deprecated,
and static factory methods were added.
The constructors are still available
but should no longer be used.
The constructors will be removed
in a future release of the Parallel Java Library.
The constructors were deprecated
because the static factory methods
provide greater programming flexibility.
<P>
Revised code throughout the Parallel Java Library
not to use the deprecated classes and constructors.

for computing &pi; using a Monte Carlo technique,
an example of an algorithm
that uses reduction on a cluster parallel computer.

when a process did a receive from "any channel."

<P><DT>01-Feb-2006
<DD>
Fixed a bug involving packages edu.rit.mp,
edu.rit.pj, and edu.rit.pj.cluster;
when an object was sent in a message through a communicator,

the object would not deserialize properly at the destination
(an exception would be thrown).

<P><DT>30-Jan-2006
<DD>
In package edu.rit.mp:
Redesigned the package again.
The separate Src and Dst classes
were combined into a single Buf class
